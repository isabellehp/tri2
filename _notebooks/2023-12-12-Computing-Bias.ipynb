    "The existence of prejudiced outcomes in the decisions or predictions made by computer systems/algorithms. Bias can be implemented into algorithms because of human biases being intentionally inserted or because of the data utilized being biased.\n",

    "Based on either explicit/implicit data that has been used to train an algorithm, whether intentionally introduced or during the process of training data generation, bias can be created. \n",
    "\n",
    "A notable example of this is seen in Netflix, where there are is a human factor that drives bias: Netflix exclusives are placed ahead (a show that is a Netflix exclusive means that users will be more likely to stay with Netflix). The bias in this case is Netflix's prioritzation towards Netflix-produced shows.\n",
